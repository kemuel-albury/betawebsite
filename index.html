        Climate change defines a change in average conditions such as temperature and rainfall.
         Global climate change refers to the long-term average shifts around the entire world. Greenhouse gases exist naturally and by preventing some of the sun's warmth from reflecting into space and rendering Earth livable, are crucial to the survival of humans and millions of other living beings.<br> But after more than a century and a half of industrialization, deforestation, and large-scale agriculture, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have increased to record levels that have not been seen in three million years.
         In the last 650,000 years there have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and of human civilization.<br>
        With that being said, we will assist those that are in need by directing them to the nearest food stores,
        hurricane shelters, providing data charts and information about climate change and how to prevent it.

                <h3>Carbon Footprint Calculator</h3>
                <p>When we do things such as disposing waste, driving a car or even 
              using electricity these all create something called greenhouse gas emissions.<br>
              When these emissions are added up, it results in a household's <strong>carbon footprint</strong>.<br>
              This calculator will give you the total of your footprint, starting from your home energy 
              to your waste and transportation.
